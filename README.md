# 🧑‍💻 Usage

### 1️⃣ Select Time Range

The `TimeSelector` component allows users to select a time range for the dashboard data.

Available options:

- 1 Day
- 1 Week
- 1 Month
- 1 Year

When a time range is selected, the dashboard dynamically fetches and displays data corresponding to that period.

---

### 2️⃣ View Metrics

The dashboard displays the following key metrics in the form of cards:

- **Total Users**  
  The total number of active, inactive, and new users.

- **New Leads**  
  The number of leads that have been converted over the selected time range.

- **Closed Deals**  
  The number of deals that were lost.

- **Open Tickets**  
  The number of unresolved tickets.

---

### 3️⃣ View Charts

#### Pie Chart

The `PieChart` component visually represents the distribution of users across different departments such as:

- Marketing
- Sales
- Support

Each department is color-coded to distinguish them easily.

---

#### Line Chart

The `LineChart` component shows the trend of leads over the selected time range.

It helps visualize how the number of leads fluctuates over time. Data points are plotted for each time period (e.g., monthly or yearly), allowing tracking of progress or changes effectively.

---

### 4️⃣ Data Fetching

The data is fetched from a mock API using **axios**.

The API returns the number of users, leads, and tickets for each time range. The data is dynamically updated based on the selected time range and displayed in the respective charts and cards.
